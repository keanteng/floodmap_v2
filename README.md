# Streamlit App For Flood Incidents in Malaysia
An app powered by Streamlit to visualize the flood incidents in Malaysia from 2015 to 2022. 

> This is an old repo, the new repo is moved to streanlitfloodv2

## Flood Mapping Tool
The web app contains a feature to allow user to estimate flood extent using Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture radar SAR data. 

## Using this repository
1. Make sure you have installed all the packages in `requirements.txt`
2. If you are running this repo on your local Windows machine, you will probably encounter `fcntl module not found ` error. But this repo can still do fine on the web app
    - Go to [Google Earth Engine ](https://earthengine.google.com/) and create an account
    - Go to Windows terminal:
    ```python
    py -m pip install ee
    import ee
    ee.Authenticate()
    ```
    - You will need to paste the authorization code back on the terminal. Once the step is complete, you can find the token on your local machine at `C:\\Users\\Username\\.congif\\earthengine\\credentials`
3. Now assuming you have created an empty repository on you GitHub account and put everything in this repository there
    - Go to [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and create an account there. Remember to link to your GitHub account. 
    - Then you need to deploy your repository you created just now. 
    - Before you click deploy, select advanced option and fill up the secret using the information in `C:\\Users\\Username\\.congif\\earthengine\\credentials`. You need to copy everything there. 
    ```toml
    EARTHENGINE_TOKEN = 'PASTE WHAT YOU COPY HERE'
    ee_keys = 'PASTE WHAT YOU COPY HERE'
    ```
