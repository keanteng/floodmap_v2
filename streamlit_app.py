    This is a multipage app that uses [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) to visualize flood incidents in Malaysia from 2015 - 2022. In this app you can find different pages that visualize the data in different ways. 
    The data for the chart is obtained from the annual report published by the Department of Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia (JPS). The app is also powered by some feature develop by 
    [mapaction/flood mapping tool](https://github.com/mapaction/flood-mapping-tool) and [opengeos/streamlit-geospatial](https://github.com/opengeos/streamlit-geospatial) that make use of
